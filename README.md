# Software-Engineering-Project
Our team is made out of the best engineers in the domain: Nicoara Andreea (project manager), Stefan Stanciu (backend/frontend), Lupascu Codrin (backend/frontend) and Bianca Ciobanu (designer).

The project we have worked on goes by the name of "UPB Shooter", a first person shooter type of game. In this game, players will assume the role of a skilled soldier fighting against zombies in a modern-day setting. The game will feature fast-paced, tactical gameplay, with a focus on team-based play and objective-based modes. Players will be able to customize their characters and loadouts, and will have access to a wide range of weapons and equipment. The game will also feature a compelling story told through cutscenes and dialogue, as well as immersive sound effects and music.

We came to an agreement regarding the use of Unreal Engine 5 for creating our game as we believe that it is both user friendly and has great outcomes. UE 5 is Epic Games' creation platform and several upcoming games have confirmed using it, especially since the State of Unreal 2020 event where EG has declared that it is free for all developers.
